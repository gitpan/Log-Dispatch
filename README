Log::Dispatch is a suite of OO modules for logging messages to
multiple outputs, each of which can have a minimum and maximum log
level.  It is designed to be easily subclassed, both for creating a
new dispatcher object and particularly for creating new outputs.

History

1.2

- Log/Dispatch.pm: Added callbacks parameter to Log::Dispatch->new.  I
will also be adding this to the Log::Dispatch::* classes via
Log::Dispatch::Output but I wanted to get this new version out there
because I think there are people out there who would benefit from
this.  Expect a 1.2x release sometime in the near future.
- Log/Dispatch.pm: Added docs section on why Log::Dispatch doesn't add
newlines to outgoing messages.

1.11

- Realized I need to tweak the $VERSION in Log::Dispatch

1.1

- upped version to 1.1 to indicate my confidence in this release (I'm
just aking for bug reports, I know).
- added accepted_levels method to Log::Dispatch::Output based on
discussions with Dominique Dumont (author of the Log::Dispatch::Tk
suite).
- canonical names for log levels are now the unabbreviated form
(though the abbreviated ones used by syslog are still fine and there
is no plan to deprecate them).  This really only affects what is
returned by the new accepted_levels method.

1.010

- fixed a bug in the DESTROY method of Log::Dispatch::Email that
caused an annoying error and may have caused spurious emails to be
sent (thanks to Radu Greab).
- fixed a bug in Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSendmail.  For some reason
this module demands a 'from' address.

1.009

- Created this version simply to address an issue with CPAN and my
internal version numbers having a conflict.  This has no changes from
1.008.

1.008

- Fixed a bug causing unitialized value warnings with -w (oops).
- Fixed a minor mistake in Log::Dispatch::Syslog docs (thanks to Ilya
Martynov)
- Put newlines into messages in SYNOPSIS sections for some modules.
This is to clarify that you need to do this.  Just to be clear,
Log::Dispatch does not alter message content in any manner whatsoever
(and never will).  However, it would be trivial to subclass
Log::Dispatch to do this.

1.007

- First public release.  It passes its own test suite so it should
work (he says hopefully).
